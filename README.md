# Barrier-optimization-method
This project implements logarithmic barrier method with backtracking line search to solve a minimization problem.

The codes presented here implement the logarithmic barrier method with backtraking line search to compute the minimum of the desired function :

min f(x) := c'x

under constraints: Ax<b
